##Learning C
This repo contains the solutions (unoficially) for the famous book *The C Programming Language* written by Kerninghan and Ritche, at Bell Labs. While this is an atypical language to learn in this day and age, as many people move onto 'web apps', speaking with a lot of industry experts led me to the realization that many concepts and underlying solutions that are encountered in various fields can be much easily addressed by C. As such, as with any language, this book is challenging and needs some time to be digested properly, so here goes! Feel free to fork and reuse.
