In order to write a test for the word counting program, I would:
* Read in a text file that is improperly formatted
* Write a quick document containing the cases which out program should handle,
in a multiplicity of areas
* write a couple of test cases. 
The input that will most likely uncover any bugs will be the one that has 'split' words, which are simply characters by not words altogher s o i t w o u l d b e l i k e t h i s but each letter would be a word. Probably a very poorly formatted child's essay, as this would most likely fit the bill
